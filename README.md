# Frontend Build: React App

This project will be the new react project arechetype for decoupled react rendering. In this mode, the react app will no longer be bundled into clientlibs, but be hosted elsewhere and just consume AEM content.

This application is built to consume the AEM model of a site. It will automatically generate the layout using the helper components from the [`@adobe/aem-react-editable-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/aem-react-editable-components) package.

## Details

The implementation is based on [aem-wknd-react-spa](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/spa-editor/react/overview.html?lang=en).

To get started:

* Start a project from the aem-wknd-react-spa archetype.
* Clone this project
* Run the aem instance and this repo to see content in the react app
